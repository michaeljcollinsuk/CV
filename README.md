After running an eBay vintage clothes store, I realised I was more interested in building the webpages than selling the clothes. I got into coding and was hooked by it's problem solving nature. I joined Makers Academy where I became passionate about striving for clean code and developed a healthy obsession for refactoring. I'm committed to a career as a developer, and would love to work with an enthusiastic team where I will continue to will continue to be pushed to my limits and challenged every day.

## Skills

#### Software/Web development

I've already formed a strong foundation in front and back-end development following the best practices within TDD, OOP and XP. I'm always striving to improve my skills and knowledge - I've gone from staying up late working on katas to building entire projects. I'm hooked now and have a real thirst to keep learning and become the best developer I can be.

- Always striving to write clean, well-tested, reusable code. I've come to really enjoy refactoring regularly.
- Obsessive attention to detail and keen problem-solver. And debugging. Lots of debugging.
- Main languages Ruby and Javascript. Also built projects using frameworks: Rails, AngularJS, Sinatra.
- Worked with API's, both creating my own and connecting to external API's such as Instagram, World Weather Online and Webhose.io.
- Currently reading Sandi Metz's Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby and refactoring old projects.


#### Teamwork

In previous jobs I've have been part of teams that helped plan and run events for large institutions such as the University of Sheffield and London Zoo. At Makers Academy I worked in small teams to produce projects I'm really proud of. My pair partners told me that I was always willing to help and was extremely patient with them.

- Confident communicator, excellent listener, always adaptable. "The patience of a saint", [quote Sarah Crawley](https://github.com/sara6).
- Pair programmed every day at Makers Academy, where I really honed my communication skills, and relished receiving feedback on my code.
- Worked in a team of four to produce our final project over two weeks: [Salty Daze](https://mighty-sands-50291.herokuapp.com/#/map).
- In my brief stints in the world of PR I worked with clients including EA and Paramount.
- (Tried) to play Rugby League for Hillsborough Hawks in my teens. Excellent at passing the ball to the players better than me. Scored a try, once.


#### Self driven

I started my own eBay business to be independent and do something for myself, and I'm proud of what I achieved. At Makers Academy I have relearnt how to learn, with the emphasis on solving problems using my own initiative.

- I ran my own eBay store for three years, doing everything myself - from buying stock to going to the post office.
- Then gave it up to attend the most intensive 12 weeks of learning of my life in search of a more challenging career.
- Comfortable working on my own when necessary. Completed six solo projects at Makers Academy.
- As a freelance journalist, meeting deadlines to file copy was an integral part of the job.
