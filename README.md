After starting an eBay vintage clothes store, I realised I was more interested in building the website than selling the clothes. I got into coding and was hooked by it's problem solving nature. I joined Makers Academy where I became passionate about striving for clean code and developed a healthy obsession for refactoring. I'm committed to a career as a developer, and would love to work with an enthusiastic team that can be proud of their code as well as their product.
